# Banking PnL & Risk Platform (PySpark + Airflow)

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Enterprise-grade platform delivering daily PnL, risk metrics, and regulatory compliance at scale across trading and banking books. Processes tens of millions of trades and billions of market data points with minute-level intraday refresh capabilities.

**Regulatory Scope**: Basel III/IV (FRTB, SACCR, RWA), CCAR/DFAST, MiFID II, EMIR, Dodd-Frank compliance. Outputs directly feed capital planning, regulatory entity reporting, and executive management information.

**Technology Stack**: PySpark for distributed analytics, Apache Airflow for orchestration, Delta Lake for ACID transactions, with optional Kafka for real-time streaming.
