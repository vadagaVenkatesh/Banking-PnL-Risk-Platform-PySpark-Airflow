"""Counterparty Risk Module

This module calculates and monitors counterparty credit risk including CVA, DVA, FVA,
and counterparty exposure metrics.

Main Responsibilities:
- Calculate counterparty exposure (current and potential future)
- Compute Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA)
- Monitor counterparty limits and concentrations
- Support netting and collateral management
